## Requirements 🛠️

1. Python 3.9 or higher
2. SQLite3
3. gitbash, linux terminal or mac-terminal (to run shell-script)

## How to run ⚡

1. Open a terminal which fits the requirements and navigate to `TEATERDB` - folder
2. Run `sh main.sh` to create the database, insert data, and make queries. The shellscript will prompt you to provide two inputs:
   - A date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - A name in the format `Firstname Lastname`
  
## View the results

All of the outputs from the different queries will be stored in the `output` folder.

## Run the python functions

Tasks 4 and 7 asked us to implement dynamic queries with python.
If you want to run the python functions without going through the shellscript, you can navigate to the files, and run the main functions.
