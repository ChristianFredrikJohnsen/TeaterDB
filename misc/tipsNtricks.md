## Data types ðŸ”¤

SQLite3 has a few data types that are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a table. The data types in SQLite3 are:

1. **NULL**: The value is a NULL value.
2. **INTEGER**: The value is a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
3. **REAL**: The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
4. **TEXT**: The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
5. **BLOB**: The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.

## On Update and On Delete

When a table is created, you can specify what happens when a referenced row is updated or deleted. This is done using the `ON UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` clauses. The possible actions are:

- **SET NULL**: The foreign key values are set to NULL when a referenced row is updated or deleted.
- **SET DEFAULT**: The foreign key values are set to their default value when a referenced row is updated or deleted.
- **CASCADE**: The changes are cascaded through the foreign key relationship. In practice, this means that if a referenced row is updated, then the referencing rows are also updated.
Similarly, if a referenced row is deleted, then the referencing rows are also deleted.
- **RESTRICT**: The changes are restricted by the foreign key relationship. In practice, this means that if a referenced row is updated or deleted, then the change is not allowed if there are any referencing rows. This seems to be the default behavior if no `ON UPDATE` or `ON DELETE` clause is specified.
- **NO ACTION**: This is the same as `RESTRICT`.
